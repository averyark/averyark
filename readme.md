## Welcome to my portfolio 
[WIP]
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Avery (not my real name), thank you for visiting. I'm 19 and I started coding since I was 7, passion is the drive. Currently, I'm studying Diploma in ICT and Software Enginerring at Asia Pasific University. Also within this timeframe, I learnt how to code in several languages: Luau, Lua, Python, Go, Rust, C++ and C. I thrive to learn more so this is not the end of the list.

### Ambition

I always dreamt of being a business owner, and it will stay as my goal. Starting a company aside, all business founders start humbly so I'm not an exception. I must go job hunting and work for a thriving company that will bring me indespensible knowledge and experience. Nothing stops me!

### Roblox
This is where I gathered many of the crucial experience that would start my career. In Roblox, Lua or Luau is used as the primary language. Note that some place or repo may not be public.

### Journal

<details>
    <summary> Expand </summary>
My history spans beyond a decade. I was 7 when I was first introduced into coding in my primary school's computer classes, I remember the concept of coding sounds so cool to me when I was a kid, it inspired me. Back then at my school there were special extra classes in my, I went home to urge my family to sign me up to basically every class that involved coding and enginering. <br><br>


The first classes I got into was a drag and drop visual coding language called Scratch, I also got into lego robotics building and programming during the same time. The classes were amazing, I was so excited for these classes everyday. These are the founding blocks for my career, I won't be here without Scratch and Lego Robotics.<br>

Now, time travelling to 2013, when I was 9. It was about the time I got into Roblox, a platformer similar to Scratch but much bigger and popular. Roblox is a 3d platform that provides you all the necessary resource like hosting, advertising on platform and a quite powerful engine. I started by placing random blocks in Roblox Studio, then I began placing random "Free Models" from the asset store that is built into Roblox Studio.<br>

It is also when I discovered I could look into other people's code from "Free Models" and I would how to code in luau/lua by searching up keywords online, we don't have ChatGPT or any usable generative AI models back in the days so I used Google, YouTube and the documentation made by Roblox. It wasn't long until I began making my own scripts, then my own games. I wasn't able to produce any playable fully completed games this time.<br>

I didn't have my own computer up until 2019 which is when my Mom bought me a laptop on my birthday this year. I began making money from small commissions. 2020, the early pandemic year wasn't memorable but I accepted my first job for thousand of dollars that consecutively for multiple jobs. This is the most transformative year for me, beacuse I was able earn a living on my own at the age of 14.

2024 was when I got into university to study in ICT and Software Enginerring. So far, it's been great.
