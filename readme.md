## Welcome to my portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Avery (not my real name). 19 years old and coded since 7, passion is the drive. Thank you so much for visiting. Within this timeframe, I learnt how to code in several languages: Luau, Lua, Python, Go, Rust, C++ and C.

### Journal

My history spans beyond a decade. I was 7 when I was first introduced into coding in my primary school's computer classes, I remember the concept of coding sounds so cool to me when I was a kid, it inspired me. Back then at my school there were special extra classes in my, I went home to urge my family to sign me up to basically every class that involved coding and enginering.

The first classes I got into was about a drag and drop like visual coding language called Scratch, I also got into lego robotics building and programming. It was amazing, I was so excited for these classes everyday.
