### Journal

My history spans beyond a decade. I was 7 when I was first introduced into coding in my primary school's computer classes, I remember the concept of coding sounds so cool to me when I was a kid, it inspired me. Back then at my school there were special extra classes in my, I went home to urge my family to sign me up to basically every class that involved coding and enginering.

The first classes I got into was about a drag and drop like visual coding language called Scratch, I also got into lego robotics building and programming. It was amazing, I was so excited for these classes everyday.
